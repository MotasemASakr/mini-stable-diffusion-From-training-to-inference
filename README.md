## Mini Stable Diffusion for 16x16 Sprites
Welcome to the Mini Stable Diffusion project repository! This project focuses on training a mini model to generate 16x16 pixel sprites using Stable Diffusion. The model is trained using two different methods: with context (e.g., hero, non-hero, food, spell, side-facing) and without context.
